									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon fa fa-heart" style="font-size:90px"></span>
										<h3>Game developer and Web developer</h3>
										<p>My interest in IT is divided into 2 stages.</p>
											<p>When I was young, I was totally addicted in playing games including online games, offline games in smartphone as well as mobile phone and so on. One day, I accidentally saw my father watching a documentary movie name ‘Game over: Kasparov and the machine'. The movie was about Kasparov won the IBM Deep Blue with the score 4-2 in six matches in 1996; however, after IBM upgraded its Deep Blue computer in 1997 with the ability to calculate 200 million steps per second, Kasparov became the first chess champion to fail in a machine. Since that, my interest in IT was becoming a game developer.</p>
											<p>However, when I grew up, I have changed my mind. My family runs a small private business but in a traditional way. I realized that my family business still have not had any own websites. Due to the development of Internet, Information Technology (IT) plays an essential role in modern world. Therefore, I want to help my parents to build and develop a business website. In other words, my interest in IT is web developer at the moment.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:90px"></span>
										<h3>Reason</h3>
										<p>According to University Rankings, RMIT is top one Australian universities operating Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with excellent IT courses. Also, as I had said above that I want to support my family business, I choose this course as my elective.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="fa fa-commenting" style="font-size:90px"></span>
										<h3>Expectation</h3>
										<p>During my studies, I expect to learn the foundation knowledge of contemporary Information Technology areas, software, applications and job skills required to enter the IT market as well as the practical application of the knowledge gained from the theoretical content based on course description.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>In fact, the phrase ‘Internet of thing' (IoT) is becoming popular and spread out around the world. This leads to IT jobs are increasing significantly.</p>
									<p>For me, my ideal job which I am looking for would be</p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon fa fa-pencil-square-o"></span>
										</br>Gain <strong>Skills</strong>
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa fa-line-chart"></span>
										</br>High <strong>Salary</strong>
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon fa fa-share-alt"></span>
										</br>Connect <strong>Community</strong>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>There are some positions for this job on Seek or Jora but I am quite keen on website developer (ecommerce) of Overdose Digital on Seek 
									<br>
									<a href= "https://www.seek.com.au/job/36725791?type=standard.html" target="_blank">This is a link to this job website </a>
								</p>
								<p class="content">								
									<p>As there is no description about the job, I think this will be about design website and manage database, manage security standards for web projects, test and debug projects, ongoing enhancement and support, create technical documentation. To me, I am quite a new comer so I do not have much experiences before. However, the advertising shows that it is acceptable for a quick learner. Additionally, the company offers personal annual training/seminar allowance because I also want to learn something new.</p>
									<br>
									The job requirements are
										<br>
										Skills: Professional communication in dealing with clients including internal team and external stakeholders in order to meet requirements; engagement throughout the process; time management; keep track websites across a variety of hosting set-ups
										<br>
										Qualifications: Have a solid comprehension of UI, cross-program similarity, general website functions and guidelines, security requirements;
										<br>
										Experience: proficient with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, , management tools such as Google Docs, Trello, Slack and email, and Sketch, Adobe Photoshop or similar.
									</p>
									<p>Since I completed some courses at RMIT and joined several club activities in RMIT Vietnam, I have worked well with project management tools such as Google Docs, Trello, Slack and email, and experienced at working with Sketch, Adobe Photoshop or similar. Additionally, RMIT Melbourne is an international environment, so this teaches me how to cooperate with others through group assessments.</p>
									<p>Therefore, in order to improve these skills about technology I will take enrollment on some courses of Bachelor’s degree of Information Technology at RMIT as my electives. For example Introduction to Information Technology, Introduction to Programming, and so on. At the moment I am enrolling the course Introduction to Information Technology to briefly grasp knowledge about technology and information technology. Furthermore, at the same time I will ask my friends studying about this bachelor's degree to gain extra knowledge. Also I will take part in some career expos relating to IT such as IP Expo in London in October. I suppose this will take a long time to gain skillful as a professor but my plan for this will take place for around one year.</p>
