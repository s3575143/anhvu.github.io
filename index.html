									<h2><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon fa fa-heart" style="font-size:90px"></span>
										<h3><strong>Game developer and Web developer</strong></h3>
										<p>My interest in IT is divided into 2 stages.</p>
											<p>When I was young, I was totally addicted in playing games including online games, offline games in smartphone as well as mobile phone and so on. One day, I accidentally saw my father watching a documentary movie name ‘Game over: Kasparov and the machine'. The movie was about Kasparov won the IBM Deep Blue with the score 4-2 in six matches in 1996; however, after IBM upgraded its Deep Blue computer in 1997 with the ability to calculate 200 million steps per second, Kasparov became the first chess champion to fail in a machine. Since that, my interest in IT was becoming a game developer.</p>
											<p>However, when I grew up, I have changed my mind. My family runs a small private business but in a traditional way. I realized that my family business still have not had any own websites. Due to the development of Internet, Information Technology (IT) plays an essential role in modern world. Therefore, I want to help my parents to build and develop a business website. In other words, my interest in IT is web developer at the moment.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:90px"></span>
										<h3><strong>Reason</strong></h3>
										<p>According to University Rankings, RMIT is top one Australian universities operating Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with excellent IT courses. Also, as I had said above that I want to support my family business, I choose this course as my elective.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="fa fa-commenting" style="font-size:90px"></span>
										<h3><strong>Expectation</strong></h3>
										<p>During my studies, I expect to learn the foundation knowledge of contemporary Information Technology areas, software, applications and job skills required to enter the IT market as well as the practical application of the knowledge gained from the theoretical content based on course description.</p>
									</li>

									<h2><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p>In fact, the phrase ‘Internet of thing' (IoT) is becoming popular and spread out around the world. This leads to IT jobs are increasing significantly.</p>
								<p>For me, my ideal job which I am looking for would be</p>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon fa fa-pencil-square-o"></span>
										</br>Gain <strong>Skills</strong>
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa fa-line-chart"></span>
										</br>High <strong>Salary</strong>
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon fa fa-share-alt"></span>
										</br>Connect <strong>Community</strong>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>There are some positions for this job on Seek or Jora but I am quite keen on website developer (ecommerce) of Overdose Digital on Seek 
									<br>
									<a href= "https://www.seek.com.au/job/36725791?type=standard.html" target="_blank">This is a link to this job website </a>
								</p>
								<p class="content">								
									<p>As there is no description about the job, I think this will be about design website and manage database, manage security standards for web projects, test and debug projects, ongoing enhancement and support, create technical documentation. To me, I am quite a new comer so I do not have much experiences before. However, the advertising shows that it is acceptable for a quick learner. Additionally, the company offers personal annual training/seminar allowance because I also want to learn something new.</p>
									<br>
									<strong>The job requirements are</strong>
										<br>
										Skills: Professional communication in dealing with clients including internal team and external stakeholders in order to meet requirements; engagement throughout the process; time management; keep track websites across a variety of hosting set-ups
										<br>
										Qualifications: Have a solid comprehension of UI, cross-program similarity, general website functions and guidelines, security requirements;
										<br>
										Experience: proficient with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, , management tools such as Google Docs, Trello, Slack and email, and Sketch, Adobe Photoshop or similar.
									</p>
									<p>Since I completed some courses at RMIT and joined several club activities in RMIT Vietnam, I have worked well with project management tools such as Google Docs, Trello, Slack and email, and experienced at working with Sketch, Adobe Photoshop or similar. Additionally, RMIT Melbourne is an international environment, so this teaches me how to cooperate with others through group assessments.</p>
									<p>Therefore, in order to improve these skills about technology I will take enrollment on some courses of Bachelor’s degree of Information Technology at RMIT as my electives. For example Introduction to Information Technology, Introduction to Programming, and so on. At the moment I am enrolling the course Introduction to Information Technology to briefly grasp knowledge about technology and information technology. Furthermore, at the same time I will ask my friends studying about this bachelor's degree to gain extra knowledge. Also I will take part in some career expos relating to IT such as IP Expo in London in October. I suppose this will take a long time to gain skillful as a professor but my plan for this will take place for around one year.</p>

								</ul>
								<p>Through these above tests, I realized I still work on emotion and be quite an unconfident person. However,  in return I am responsibility, can observe the overall work, listening to opinions of other, and remember things quickly by capturing picture in my head.
Therefore, I can not become a good leader but I can encourage the will, inspire the ideas and motivate spirit group member.</p>
								<p>So how should I take this into account when forming team? I think I’d better form team with heterogenous. In other words, choosing group member with different personalities to complement each other.</p>

									<h2><strong>Project Ideas</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p>
								<span class="icon fa fa-rocket" style="font-size:40px"></span>
									</br><h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
								<br>
								My project will be developing a smartphone app for delivering takeaway food and drink around Australia named Clytie. Although there are many food delivery apps operated in Australia, this app will be the collaboration among those food apps such as Foodora, UberEats, Deliveroo and Menulogs. Besides, the app also shows how many kcal of any food or drink before purchasing in order to balance the energy and control the weight. Especially, this Clytie app also allows user to pay by cash on delivery or card after ordering. This smartphone app is promised to be designed with easy-to-view interface.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								<span class="icon fa fa-rocket" style="font-size:40px"></span>
									</br><h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
								<br>
								According to Carey (2018), Australians are spending an incredible $2.6 billion each year on food and drink delivery through companies such as Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora (Figure 1). Additionally, Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular ordering times (Sullivan 2017). In other words, developing this app will take advantage of creating network with delivery service companies like Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora, and making a huge profits from Australia citizens.

								</p>
								
								<p>
								<span class="icon fa fa-rocket" style="font-size:40px"></span>
									</br><h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
								<br>
								To illustrate, this Clytie app will be suitable for all ages and be charged $10 AUD when it is downloaded and installed on any users' smartphone. The reason why this app is surcharged whereas other apps like Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora are free installation is that it guarantees a 5-minute delivery earlier even in rush hours.
								<br>
								So how to use it next? Consumer needs to sign up an user account in order to save the delivery address and accumulate points for discount program at the end of each year. After that, the app will automatically log in that account. Of course the ordering style of Clytie app is as same as other apps such as Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora. It will auto access the current location of that account to find and suggest which restaurants are nearby as well as recommend the best-seller foods and drinks in those restaurants. Or otherwise, user can search any restaurants' name or favourite food which they like in the ‘search' box. Also this app will show which partners in charge of that restaurant to facilitate the bill and the deliverer. Then the app will automatically send message back to user to confirm the order after they have chosen food or drink from restaurant as well as the estimated time. Especially, the difference of this app is that user can choose one of two payment ways. One is paying cash when receiving order, and another is paying immediately by credit card when order is confirmed. Besides, user can also keep track the process as this smartphone app will send message after each done step. Please see picture to take a look more detail and clearer.

								<img src="images/app2.jpg" align="centre" height="400px" width="250px" />
								<br>
								Before creating this Clytie app, I have to negotiate and corporate with other partners in Australia such as Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora in order to get access to maps, restaurants’ name, restaurants’ menu, menu price, estimated time to do the order, and so on from these partners. Therefore, one of the biggest problems here is to get permission from those partners as each company want to keep confidential contact of restaurants in order to get its own profit and revenue in the monopoly way. Another issue is structuring the financial cost for myself and company partners. In partners’ side, I think of about providing and developing the advanced software. Towards me, the revenue will be harvested from the installation fee minus the Google and Apple fees because both Google and Apple take 30 per cent of sales once your app is published (Franco 2018). One more thing is that menu of restaurant may change any time so this app needs to be updated at the same time with this situation.
								<br>
								And how long will Clytie app be launched? In my opinion, building this app is easy and in a shorter time, about three to four months but cooperating with other partner company may be a little difficult, about one to two years. However, I still believe in this app.

									</br><h3><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h3>
								<br>
								As the beginning of IT learner, MIT App Inventor 2 for Android platforms and Xcode 10 for iOS platforms are considered as the easiest and simplest way due to programming language.
								<br>
								To be specific, the MIT App Inventor project with Drag and Drop operation seeks to democratize software development by empowering all people, especially young people, to move from technology consumption to technology creation (MIT App Inventor). In other words, anyone even children can use it with a visual programming environment.
								<br>
								About Xcode, the source code editor helps to transform or refactor code more easily, see source control changes alongside the related line, and quickly get details on upstream code differences (Apple n.d.). Also, this helps to build own instrument with custom visualization and data analysis (Apple n.d.). Swift compiles software more quickly, helps to deliver faster apps, and generates even smaller binaries (Apple n.d.). Test suites complete many times faster, more secure, and much more (Apple n.d.).
								</p>
								
								<p>
								<span class="icon fa fa-rocket" style="font-size:40px"></span>
									</br><h3><strong>Skill Required</strong></h3>
								<br>
								Due to the fact that cybercrime is on the rise, it is expected that gaining skills to understand cyber issues, identify, diagnose and resolve these challenges in order to protect users from the risks of cyber security attacks. For example, hacker can steal information on credit card of users.
								<br>
								What’s more, setting up Clytie API (Application Programming Interface) is one of the most essential things during building Clytie app. API is seems like the bridge, or the software connections with main applications are gears that connect the parts together so that the machine can function normally. For example, when you order food but let the chef know what you ordered, so the waiter is the API connecting your information to the chef and vice versa.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								<span class="icon fa fa-rocket" style="font-size:40px"></span>
									</br><h3><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>
								<br>
								If the project is successful, the Clytie app will be popular around Australia and gradually spread out around the world. Besides, this smartphone app will replace successfully other delivery apps such as Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora app. In other words, users only need to access one app to search and order because of the convenience when combining all app in one. I will also expand the network and exchange the IT with other partner companies including Menulog, UberEats, Deliveroo and Foodora company.
